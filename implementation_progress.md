   - Add interfaces for contract interactions

2. **Integration**
   - Connect all frontend components to the smart contracts
   - Update placeholder contract addresses with actual deployed addresses
   - Implement event listeners for real-time updates
   - Implement actual API calls for protocol statistics instead of mock data

4. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Add unit tests for smart contracts
   - Test frontend integration with contracts
   - Deploy contracts to Cronos Chain testnet for initial testing
   - Conduct comprehensive user testing before mainnet deployment

## Technical Debt & Considerations

1. **Contract Addresses**
   - Current implementation uses placeholder addresses (0x0000...)
   - Need to update with actual deployed contract addresses

2. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error handling in frontend services
   - Add more detailed error messages for user feedback

3. **Security**
   - Add reentrancy protection to all contracts
   - Implement access control for admin functions
   - Add circuit breakers for extreme market conditions

4. **Performance**
   - Optimize gas usage in smart contracts
   - Implement batched operations where possible
